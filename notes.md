# STEPS

## Partials

   <!-- - Base -->
   <!-- - Header -->

-  Hamburger menu?

<!-- 2. Pages -->
<!-- - From front matter -->
<!-- - Create planet collection -->

## Styling and SCSS

-  Work on main layout
   -  Buttons at multiple viewports
   -  TODO Add in numbered items
   <!-- -  Work on details layout -->
-  Work on navigation layout
-  Add in some transition smoothing

## JS

-  Burger menu
-  Add target selector and display for text (aria/tab order?)

# FIXME

-  Text wraping on bottom flex
-  Border causing jank on mobile links, and impacted by border radius

# ReadMe

1. Many pages so some form of templating needed - SSG 11th and nunjucks. AB 11ty course with some other additions
2. Data in json. I split into seperate md files rather than iterate over object and render - best? Works well with 11th - easy to add new planets!
3. Center section layout was a challenge, wanted to keep source and tab order logical. Concluded a tabbed interface? Heydon Pickering resource.
