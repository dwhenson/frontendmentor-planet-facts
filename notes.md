# ReadMe

1. Many pages so some form of templating needed - SSG 11th and nunjucks. AB 11ty course with some other additions
2. Data in json. I split into seperate md files rather than iterate over object and render - best? Works well with 11th - easy to add new planets!
3. Center section layout was a challence, wanted to keep source and tab order logical. Concluded a tabbed interface? Heydon Pickering resource.

# FIXME

-  Text wraping on bottom flex
